# üìò Group 2

This repository contains the code and resources for our group assignment, which is part of our coursework at University of Kigali. The project is a collaborative effort among team members to learn and apply concepts in Web Design and Development.

Our goal is to work together as a team, divide tasks, and build a functioning application/solution that demonstrates our understanding of the key concepts taught in class. Each member has contributed to different sections of the project and maintained their individual progress through GitHub.

The purpose of this project is to strengthen our teamwork, improve our problem-solving skills, and gain hands-on experience with collaborative Web Design & development practices.
